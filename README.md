# SurfUp

The project implemented during the second semester involved the use of SOLID principles as a priority and the development of a Windows Forms and Razor Pages application that share the same MySQL database. The project focus was also to make use of ClassLibraries and write proper unit tests. The concept of the project was a surfer blog where users can submit pictures, videos, and articles related to their surf experiences and comment on posts.

The software solution was implemented using C# with Windows Forms and ASP.Net Core Razor Pages, with a MySQL database being used to store and manage user's posts and comments.
